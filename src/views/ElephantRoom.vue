            My path into technology is one of a self-driven learner, not a traditional student. My
            background has taught me to be resourceful and to master new skills out of a genuine
            passion for the craft. I've built a strong technical foundation through hands-on
            projects and focused, self-paced study. I believe this journey gives me a unique
            perspective on problem-solving and an unwavering motivation to learn.

            While I may be new to the tech industry, my experience is defined by a daily immersion
            in the field. I am constantly building, troubleshooting, and learning, creating
            real-world solutions that follow industry best practices. My projects bridge the gap
            between theoretical knowledge and professional practice, and I am an eager and fast
            learner who is ready to contribute, grow, and make a high-impact addition to a team.
