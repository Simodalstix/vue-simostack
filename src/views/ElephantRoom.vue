          You know I actually did the online Harvard CS50 course? Started with C, then HTML, CSS,
          Javascript and Python. I didn't finish it course because I don't have time to waste doing
          silly abstract coding exercises. I have 3 University degress and you know what I noticed,
          I Learn much faster when its self-directed, self-paced and when I'm truly motivated.

          You got me there, but I reckon experience is so overrated. Especially when the system
          encourages networking/nepotism over proficiency and competence - and thats my biggest
          weakness, I'm coming in as a lone wolf.
