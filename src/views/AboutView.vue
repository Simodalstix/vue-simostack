    <p>
      I’m building a career at the intersection of Linux, cloud infrastructure, security operations,
      and automation. My focus is on developing resilient systems and support frameworks that align
      with enterprise and public sector demands — especially where accountability, uptime, and
      traceability matter. I thrive where real engineering meets real pressure.
