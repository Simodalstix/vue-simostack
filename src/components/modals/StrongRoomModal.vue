        Unfortunately, Strongroom.AI entered voluntary administration in April 2025 due to
        operational and financial challenges, resulting in approximately 50% of staff being made
        redundant â€” including my role. Despite the short tenure, my time at Strongroom.AI solidified
        my passion for tech, accelerated my skills in AWS and infrastructure, and gave me the
        confidence to pursue a cloud and DevOps career path.
